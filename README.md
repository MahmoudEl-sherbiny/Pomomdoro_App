# Pomodoro Timer App ⏱️🍅

**Pomodoro Timer App** is a simple productivity tool built with Python that helps you manage your time using the **Pomodoro Technique**. Work in focused sessions with regular breaks to stay productive and avoid burnout.

## 🧠 What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## 📦 Features
- Work timer (default 25 minutes)
- Short break and long break cycles
- Visual tomato-themed interface using `turtle` and a tomato image
- Clear, minimal UI to keep you focused

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- `turtle` module for graphical interface
- `time` module for countdown

## 🚀 How to Run the App
1. Make sure Python is installed (3.6+ recommended).
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `main.py` (main application script)
   - `tomato.png` (used as the timer icon/graphic)
3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📁 Files Included
- `main.py` - Main Python script to launch the Pomodoro Timer
- `tomato.png` - Image of a tomato used in the UI as the Pomodoro symbol

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Launch the app.
2. The timer starts with a 25-minute work session.
3. After each work session, a short break starts.
4. Every four Pomodoros, a longer break is given.
5. The cycle repeats to keep you productive.

## 👨‍💻 Ideal For
- Students trying to focus on study sessions
- Developers needing structured coding time
- Anyone wanting to boost productivity with structured work sessions
